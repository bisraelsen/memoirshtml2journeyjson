### Under Construction!!

Utility to convert from memoirs html output to json output used in Journey

# Requirements
* Python3
* BeautifulSoup4 (this might be useful [link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26511791/ubuntu-how-to-install-a-python-module-beautifulsoup-on-python-3-3-instead-of) )
* json
* datetime

# The Basics
* `html2json.py` is the script that you need to run. Currently the information is hardcoded, but it will accept command line arguments after it is proven to work.

* Currently it is looking for the folder `output` in the base directory to put the .json files in. You will need to create that folder by hand.
